{-| A Cardano address typically holding one or two credential references.

Note that legacy bootstrap addresses (a.k.a. "Byron addresses") are completely excluded from Plutus contexts.
Thus, from an on-chain perspective only exists addresses of type 00, 01, â€¦, 07 as detailed in CIP-0019 :: Shelley Addresses.

    { paymentCredential : Credential
    , stakeCredential : Maybe StakeCredential

{-| A general structure for representing an on-chain credential.

Credentials are always one of two kinds: a direct public/private key pair, or a script (native or Plutus).

-}
type Credential
    = VerificationKeyCredential Blake2b_224
    | ScriptCredential Blake2b_224


{-| A StakeCredential represents the delegation and rewards withdrawal conditions associated with some stake address / account.

A StakeCredential is either provided inline, or, by reference using an on-chain pointer.
Read more about pointers in CIP-0019 :: Pointers.

-}
type StakeCredential
    = InlineCredential Credential
    | PointerCredential { slotNumber : Int, transactionIndex : Int, certificateIndex : Int }
